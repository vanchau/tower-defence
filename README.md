# tower-defence
School group project: tower defence game

The game was made during a C++ course without prior experience in C++.
The group consisted of four members and was a first coding project ever for most of the members.

The program can be compiled with the given makefile, and in order to compile SFML libraries have to be installed.
Alternatively, one can just run the exe in game folder.
